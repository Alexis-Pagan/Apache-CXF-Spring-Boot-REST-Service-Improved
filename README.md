# Apache-CXF-Spring-Boot-REST-Service-Improved
This REST service is programmed using Spring Boot and JAX-RS. This new version contains an example of how to manage GET and POST verbs on request. 

The following are the request URIs:

#GET:
http://localhost:8081/api/services/language/description

#POST:
http://localhost:8081/api/services/language/information/Assembly

The next version should include how to manage multiple message formats without a lot of code.
